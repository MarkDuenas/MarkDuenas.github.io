# Stacks and Queues

## Stacks

Stacks are data structures that can be described as first in, last out. Imagine a stack of bricks. The first brick goes to the bottom and the second brick goes on top of the first brick
and so on. This is the same way Stacks work. Each item in the stack holds on to a value and a reference to the next item in the stack.

There are a a few methods that Stacks such as `pop`, `push` and `peek`. `pop` and `push` are similar to the same methods that is used in JavaScript. `pop` removes the last item from the stack(top of the stack) and 
`push` adds an item to the the stack. 

## Queues

The main difference between Stacks and Queues is that Queues are first in, first out. The first item in Queues are considered in the front of the Queue and the last item in the queue is in the rear of the queue.

The methods for Queues are `enqueue` which adds to the rear of the queue, `dequeue` removes from the front of the queue.
