- Event Handler -  is a routine that deals with the event, allowing a programmer to write code that will be executed when the event occurs.
- Event Driven Programming - is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or threads.
- Event Loop - is a programming construct or design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program.
- Event Queue -  event queue is a repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system.
- Call Stack - is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.
