## Singleton

The singleton pattern is a design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

## Singleton in Node modules

Singletons are single ES6 classes that are exported at the end of the page using module.exports.

## Middleware in express

## Vocab Terms

1. Router Middleware - a middleware that is bound to an instance of the express.Router().
2. Dynamic Module Loading - the idea of importing modules only when the situation demands it.
3. Singleton Pattern - limits the number of instances of a particular object to just one.
4. CRUD -> REST Method Matches - Create, Read, Update, Delete -> POST, GET, PUT, DELETE.
5. Mock Testing - unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other system modules.
